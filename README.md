# local-assistant
free and open source alternative to other voice assistants.

## what does this software do?
local assistant is a server and client that allow you to create your own AI local voice assistant.
the assistant works as follows - listens to commands, when it hears "Hey companion!", it starts to analyze speech more carefully, if you say "play [songname]", the assistant will play a file from the folder music/ with a similar name, if you ask it a question, the answer will be generated by LLM and at the end text to speech will read the AI's answer aloud

## features
- everything is local, no need to pay for any API
- all data will stay on your local computer, you don't have to worry about data leaks
- Large Language Model (llm), conversations with an assistant are much more natural than scripted responses
- customization, you choose the artificial intelligence models you want
- you can start music by giving the title to the assistant, you don't have to touch the keyboard to hear your favorite music
- based on microservices - you can run the server on your PC, while the clients, e.g. on raspberry pi can be connecting around your house

## Usage
AI is listening all time software works, however, until it hears "hey companion!", it will not react at all.

If AI hears "Hey companion!", it will reply "I'm listening"

The AI ​​will announce that it is starting to analyze your speech if it says "I'm listening" to you in a human voice.

After that, if you say "play [song name]", the ai will start looking in the music/ folder for music with a similar name.

If you say anything else, your answer will be sent to ai-companion and LLM will generate a reply to your words.
